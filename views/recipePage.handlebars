                I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
                master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because
                those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
                anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
                occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
                which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
                has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one
                who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

              <h2> Ingredients </h2>
              <p class = "recipe-ingredients"> "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
                dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure
                of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
                trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
                in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
                shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
                distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and
                when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is
                to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing
                to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur
                that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man t
                herefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects
                 pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid
                 worse pains."
